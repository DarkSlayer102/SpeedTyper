# SpeedTyper

The Typing Speed Test is a robust Python application built using various libraries such as PySide6, PySide6.QtCore, PySide6.QtWidgets, and PySide6.QtGui. This feature-rich application provides users with an engaging platform to evaluate their typing speed, accuracy, and overall typing skills. Leveraging the wonderwords library, the application generates random sentences, challenging users to type them within a specific time frame. By utilizing time, sys, and logging libraries, the application accurately measures the typing speed, calculates words per minute (WPM), and tracks the elapsed time. With its intuitive interface, users can easily navigate through the application, view real-time feedback on their performance, and receive detailed accuracy statistics. The Typing Speed Test empowers individuals to enhance their typing proficiency and boost their productivity, making it an invaluable tool for personal growth or professional development.
